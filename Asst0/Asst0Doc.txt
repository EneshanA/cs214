Design step by step:
1)Check if arguments(argv[n]) are valid or not.
2)Read the header line from csv directed to STDIN using getline() function.
3a)Call getKey() function to seperate columns in one line by using strtok() function
3b)Check if the argument entered matches with any column from header line if it does store the number of that column
4)Depending on the column name decide which type of sorting is gonna be used(String or Double) by calling determineSortType()
5a)Read the rest of rows in the CSV file using getline(), get key fields from rows using strsep() function
5b)store each line and key fields in linkedlist by calling push() function
6)Trim the quotes from each key field by calling trimQuotes() so later on sorting can be done properly.
7)Call Merge Sort on the linked list by the sorting type
8)Print sorted list

Challenges:

- At first I used strtok() function to seperate and check fields but later on I realized that
 strtok() function is not able to handle empty spaces. So I had to use strsep()
- For extra credit, I assumed every field is numeric and checked every field for non-digit character
using isdigit() function but I had memory issues so I went with manuel if else statements.

Functions:
  a) Utility Functions:
    1) trimQuotes() it takes string, trims the quotes.
    2) SplitLL() takes the LinkedList, and seperates it into two.
    3) getKey() it matches argv[2] with the column from header line and stores the column number.
    4) getField() gets the nth column from line.
  b) Main Functions
    1)push() stores line and field in predefined structure
    2)MergeSort(), SortLL() sorts the linkedlist using mergesort algorithm
    3)printList() prints the LinkedList.

To use:
  gcc simpleCSVsorter.c -o simpleCSVsorter
  cat input_file.csv | ./simpleCSVsorter -c <column_name>

  It will sort the csv in ascending order and print to stdout.
